            cat `find -readable -size 1033c ! -executable`
                `` runs the inner command
                -readable is human readable

            cat `find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>&1 | grep -v Permission | grep -v "No such"`
            cat `find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>&1 | grep -v -E "Permission|No such"`

                2>&1 means put stderr output into the same output as stdout.
                    It looks the same because terminal displays both stdout
                    and stderr. Redirecting stderr to stdout lets the output be
                    piped to grep.
                grep -v inverts the pattern.  Instead of selecting lines with
                    permission, it matches lines without permission
                grep -E is extended regular expressions, | is or. Lines with
                    "Permission" or "No such" are filtered.

    Plan 1:
        grep -E on data.txt for a pattern match [word] millionth or millionth [word]
        "[a-zA-Z]+ millionth|millionth [a-zA-Z]+"
    Actual:
        grep -E "millionth" data.txt
        It displayed the password along with millionth
8-9: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
    Plan 1: uniq data -> grep millionth
    Outcome: Didn't work, uniq displays unique lines, not ONLY uniq lines. Also millionth isn't there.
    
    Plan 2: uniq -c -> grep "1 "
    Outcome: Didn't work, uniq only removes adjacent matching lines.
    
    Plan 3: sort data.txt | uniq -c | grep "1 "
9-10: truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
    Plan 1: strings data.txt | grep -E "={2,}"
        "={2,}" means at least 2 consecutive '='
    Outcome: success
10-11: IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
    Plan 1: base64 -d data.txt
        -d is decode
    Outcome: success

    Plan 1: tr "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" "nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM"
        translate characters from the first set to the second set   
        Then paste the contents of cat data.txt
    Outcome: success

    Plan 1: Revert hex dump with xxd -r
        uncompress until readable with gunzip
    Outcome: xxd works, first uncompress works, but next is not a .gz
    
    Plan 2: revert hex dump with xxd -r. Uncompress until readable with gunzip or bunzip2
        xxd -r
        gunzip
        bunzip2
        gunzip
    Outcome: after 2nd gunzip, can't bunzip2 or gunzip
    
    Plan 3: as before, but extract tar?
        tar xvf
        tar xvf
        left with data6.bin
        tar xvf -> data8.bin
        tar xvf data8.bin -> nothing
        change to .gz
        gunzip
        cat -> gave me password
