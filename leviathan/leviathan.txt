    ls -al to see all the things, notice there is a hidden folder .backup/
    it contains bookmarks.html
    try to look for pass or flag inside it
    Method 1: 
        I did
            scp leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org:~/.backup/bookmarks.html ./
        which puts the file on my computer. Then, just open it in a browser and
        ctrl-f for either pass or flag. Pass takes you to a link to password
        
    Method 2:
        grep -r -i "pass" .
        search recursively through folders for "pass", ignoring case
        
1-2: ougahZi8Ta
    check what there is  
        ls -al
    
    see that there is an executable, but you don't know the pass
    
    see if pass is somewhere
        grep -r -i "pass"
    results in "Binary file check matches"
        grep -ari "pass" to process in binary
    nothing good
        
    use strace to track system calls
        strace ./check
    doesn't reveal anything
    
    use ltrace to look at library calls
        ltrace ./check
    see that there is a a strcmp("l\n\n", "sex")
    
    sex is the password for check
    run it again, and you get access to a shell
        whoami
    I am leviathan2, so cd /etc/leviathan_pass, and
        cat leviathan2
        
2-3: Ahdiemoo1j
        ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
    ltrace to see that access("file", 4) is called
    if we give it a file we can read, it might pass
    
    make a tmp dir with a random file
        ltrace ./printfile /tmp/edf_lev3/file
    If it passes, it cats the file
      
    cat can take multiple params, so we can trick it into passing one file,
    then calling cat on the second.
    
        touch 'a file'
        rm file
        ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
        
        ~/printfile 'a file'
    
    first, access('a file') passes, because we have permissions for it
    then, cat a file is called
    it first tries to do 'a', which doesn't exist, then it does file, which
    does exist and succeeds, since its run as leviathan3, the symlink works.

    ./level3        // bzzzzzzap WRONG
    
    ltrace ./level3
        see that it does a strcmp("input", "snlprintf\n"), so try that as password
        it gives me a shell, but user is still leviathan3
        
    outside of ltrace,
    ./level3 snlprintf gives you a leviathan4 shell

    ll
        see hidden .trash folder 
        in it is bin, which prints out binary
        01010100 01101001 01110100 01101000 00110100 01100011 01101111 01101011 01100101 01101001 00001010
    
    ltrace ./bin
        shows fopen("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan5", "r")
        so the previous value is the password in binary
        put it through a converter
    
5-6: UgaoFee4li
    ./leviathan5
        output is cannot find /tmp/file.log
        
    ltrace ./leviathan5
        see that it calls fopen("/tmp/file.log", "r")
        have to try make it
    
    echo "HELLO" >> /tmp/file.log
    ./leviathan5
        it prints HELLO, then the file disappears
        
    echo "HELLO" >> /tmp/file.log
    ltrace ./leviathan5
        see that it does fopen("/tmp/file.log", "r"), then gets a char and prints it
        maybe we need to make a sym link called /tmp/file.log to the password
        
    ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log
    ./leviathan5

6-7: ahy7MaeBo9
    ./leviathan6
        uses 4 digit code as param
        
    ./leviathan6 0000
        Wrong
        
    ltrace ./leviathan6 1234
        only does a atoi to get the arg, then immediately says wrong
        probably need a script to try each possible arg
    
    Script is lev6.sh
    hangs on 7123, so see what's up
    
    ./leviathan6 7123
        gives us a shell, user is leviathan7, so can get the pass
        
Done
