    ls -al to see all the things, notice there is a hidden folder .backup/
    it contains bookmarks.html
    try to look for pass or flag inside it
    Method 1: 
        I did
            scp leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org:~/.backup/bookmarks.html ./
        which puts the file on my computer. Then, just open it in a browser and
        ctrl-f for either pass or flag. Pass takes you to a link to password
        
    Method 2:
        grep -r -i "pass" .
        search recursively through folders for "pass", ignoring case

    check what there is  
        ls -al
    
    see that there is an executable, but you don't know the pass
    
    see if pass is somewhere
        grep -r -i "pass"
    results in "Binary file check matches"
        grep -ari "pass" to process in binary
    nothing good
        
    use strace to track system calls
        strace ./check
    doesn't reveal anything
    
    use ltrace to look at library calls
        ltrace ./check
    see that there is a a strcmp("l\n\n", "sex")
    
    sex is the password for check
    run it again, and you get access to a shell

    I am leviathan2, so cd /etc/leviathan_pass, and
        cat leviathan2
        
2-3:
        ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
    see that access("file", R_OK) is called
    if we give it a file we can read, it might pass
    
    make a tmp dir with a random file
        strace ./printfile /tmp/edf_leviathan3/file
    it passes, then calls cat with the path
      
    cat can take multiple params, so we can exploit the path
