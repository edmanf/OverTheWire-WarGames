    check the page source, pass is there

    can't right click, so examine html using firebug
    Didn't work
    Right-clicking isn't actually blocked though
    
    Can also do ctrl-u to view page source, or download the page and look
    at it in a text editor

    look at the source, there is an image "/files/pixel.png"
    this means its the the folder files, so try
    http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files
    
    Here we see that there is a users.txt, and it has the password

    Look at source, it says google can't find it.
    This is a hint about robots.txt, which lets a site opt out
    of searches
    
    http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt
        User-agent: *
        Disallow: /s3cr3t/
        
        This means all robots should not visit 
        http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/
        
        
    this turns out to be a folder with a users.txt with the password

    Have to be authorized from natas5.
    From just typing it in, I come from "", clicking on refresh has me coming
    from natas4.
    
    Check the http requests in the browser. The difference is in the referer
    header, so make a new request with a referer set to natas5
    
    I had to download httprequester on firefox.
    
    GET http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org
    Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
    Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM0Olo5dGtSa1dtcHQ5UXI3WHJSNWpXUmtnT1U5MDFzd0Va

    Says I'm not logged in.
    Check source, nothing interesting
    
    Use firebug to check cookies, see a cookie called loggedin which is 0
    change to 1 and refresh

    Look at the source code, see that $secret must come from includes/secret.inc
    goto http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc
    and look at the source.
    Secret is: FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU
